# Automated-Attendance-System-using-Computer-Vision

* Developed a computer vision-based attendance model that automated the attendance-taking process using a group  image of a class. Implemented face detection algorithms identify &amp; locate individual student faces within the image.
* Utilized face recognition algorithms from the face_recognition library to compare the detected faces with a database of individual student images. Marked the attendance by associating each recognized student's name. 
* Stored the attendance data in a Pandas Data Frame and exported to an Excel file format using the Pandas library.

# Problem Statement
Traditional methods of manual attendance taking in classrooms are time-consuming, prone to errors, and often inefficient. There is a need for an automated system that can accurately and efficiently take attendance by analyzing a group image of a class, recognizing individual students, and marking their attendance.

# Project Objective
* Develop a computer vision-based system to automatically detect and recognize students' faces in a group image for efficient attendance tracking.
* Create a user-friendly interface that allows educators to input a group image, identify students, and generate an accurate attendance report in Excel format.
* Optimize the system for real-time or near-real-time performance to enable efficient attendance processing in classroom settings.
* Enhance data export capabilities to facilitate seamless integration with existing attendance management systems, improving overall efficiency and record-keeping.
* Process should be automatic and easy to use.

# Implementation

To develop a model that takes attendance from a group image of a class, identifies the students, and marks their attendance, you can follow these steps:
* Data Collection: Gather a dataset of individual images of each student in the class. 
* Face Detection: Use a face detection algorithm or library to detect and localize faces in the group image. 
* Face Recognition: Employ a face recognition algorithm to compare the detected faces with the individual student images to recognize and identify each student. 
* Attendance Marking: After recognizing each student's face, update their attendance status accordingly. 
* Export Attendance: Once the attendance has been marked, export the data to an Excel file.
